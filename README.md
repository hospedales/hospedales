# Michael Hospedales

**Full-Stack Engineer who ships end-to-end** · Miami, FL

I turn ideas into production-ready applications—from database design to pixel-perfect UIs. With 7+ years building web applications, I've developed a knack for choosing the right tool for each layer of the stack and making them work together seamlessly.

### What I Bring to the Table

```
Frontend        →  React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Three.js
Backend         →  Node.js, Laravel, Python, Rust, GraphQL
Data            →  PostgreSQL, SQL, REST APIs
Infrastructure  →  AWS, Azure, CI/CD, Docker
Bonus           →  AR/VR, WebGL, 3D visualization, C#
```

I'm not just comfortable across the stack—I actively enjoy the context-switching. Need someone who can debug a database query in the morning and polish a micro-interaction in the afternoon? That's my sweet spot.

### Featured Work

**[Aggregate Open Tabs](https://github.com/hospedales/vscode-aggregate-open-tabs)** – VS Code extension that consolidates your open files into a single document. Useful for code reviews, documentation, and AI-assisted development.

**[Prompt Stash](https://github.com/hospedales/prompt_stash_n_instruction)** – Prompting patterns and techniques I've refined while working with LLMs. Part of my deeper dive into AI engineering and understanding how to communicate effectively with these models.
